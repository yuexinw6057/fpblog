Today, I completed the content for my website.   

I learned how to use containers to help me position my div tags.   

I used google, ww3 schools, and css tricks to help me.   

A skill that I used was debugging and patiences. These two skills will allow me to work effectively when it comes to   

coding. In order to solve a mistake, you will need both of these.
