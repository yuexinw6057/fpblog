Blog Entry # 2					     Date: 11/01/2019

Today, I focused on researching and planning.   

I learned some of the things that people can do to keep themselves safe online, as well as learning mardown.

I also offered some tips to help them stay safe even when they are not on the deep web or the darkweb.   

I am currently at the research stage and understanding more of my topic. I am also learning command line and github in the process.
