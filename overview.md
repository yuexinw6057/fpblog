    For my project, I am making a website about the dark web using Github, HTML, CSS, and javascript. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying how to code, 
understanding how the darkweb works and making the website. The “Freedom Project” for SEP10 is all about exploring your interest and also applying it into my real life into the future.
It really is efficent when you want be a web designer in the future. The purpose of this blog is to spread information and awareness of darkweb and how dangerous it is.
