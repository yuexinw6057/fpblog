Blog Entry # 1					     Date: 10/25/2019

Today, I focused on researching what is the darkweb and the different things that are present in the internet.   

I am in the process of prototyping.   

I am using markdown to record what I have seen on github.  

Resources I used are the internet and class instructions.   

I learned how to filter items by using google, helping me to find stuff more easily;
as well as organizing my files in order for it to be easily accessible and not messy.
