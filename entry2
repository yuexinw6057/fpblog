Today, I focused on searching up some warnings and stories to make people make the best choice to not go onto the dark web for their self protection and for their safety.
I also offered some tips to help them stay safe even when they are not on the deep web or the darkweb.
I am currently at the research stage and understanding more of my topic. I am also learning command line and github in the process.
