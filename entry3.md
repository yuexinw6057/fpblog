Today I am in my testing and improving process

I learned css and html, as well as responsive web development tools.

I used Ww3 schools, class instruction, freecodecamp, css-tricks...etc

A skill that I used was debugging and collaboration. Collaboration will be a huge part of my future career in my opinion, practicing now will help me have an easier time in the future.
